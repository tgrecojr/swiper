# Reporting Periods Configuration
# Define the reporting periods for attendance tracking.
# Each period must specify:
#   - period_number: Unique period identifier (must be > 0)
#   - start_date: First day of the period (YYYY-MM-DD)
#   - end_date: Last day of the period (YYYY-MM-DD)
#   - report_date: Date by which compliance must be reported (YYYY-MM-DD)
#
# The duration of each period is calculated from the start_date and end_date.
# There are no assumptions about period length - periods can be any duration.
